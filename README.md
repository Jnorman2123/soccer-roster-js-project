This is my JavaScript project which is an index of soccer leagues from around the world and soccer teams that belong to each league.
To begin fork and clone this repo.  Once installed you will need to cd into js-project-backend and run rails s to start the rails api server.
Then in the js-project-frontend folder simply open index.html in your preferred browser. 
You will be presented with an index page of the leagues currently available.  From here you can choose to view the teams index, the league show page, and bring up the form to add a new league. 
From each leagues show page you can view the teams that are in that league, edit the league, as well as add a new team to the league.
The teams show page has options to edit or delete a team or navigate back to the league to which it belongs.
